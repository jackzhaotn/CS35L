Lab 1: Linus and Emacs scavenger hunt

1. I learned from, man man, that the shell command, man -k <printf>, searches for short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.

2. Using shell command: which mv, I found mv to be located at /usr/local/cs/bin/mv
   Using shell command: which sh, I found sh to be located at /usr/bin/sh

3. I used, man find, to learn more about the find command.
   Using the shell command, find /usr/bin -name "?r" -executable, it listed the following (and their function description as given by: man <program>):
   	/usr/bin/tr (tr: translate or delete characters)
	/usr/bin/ar (ar :create, modify, and extract from archives)
	/usr/bin/pr (pr: convert text files for printing)

4. I used man -k link and found the command readline /usr/bin/emacs
   The output shows that /etc/alternatives/emacs is actually executed

5. Shell command, /usr/bin/gcc -v, shows that the version is 4.85
   whereas, gcc -v, shows that plain gcc version is 9.3.0.
   Under further investigation of plain gcc, which gcc, shows that the two gcc programs are in different directories meaning that they are different programs.

6. u+sx adds user permissions to set SUID of SGID attribute and to execute a file
   o-w removes other user group permissions of writing to a file.

7. I went through man find to learn about the different arguments and flags that limit the search. I used  find/usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28
   Because there are so many directories found, only some are list below:
   	   /usr/local/cs
	   /usr/local/cs/src/git
	   /usr/local/cs/src/git/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/src/coreutils
	   /usr/local/cs/src/coreutils/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/src/gcc
	   /usr/local/cs/src/gcc/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/src/gdb
	   /usr/local/cs/src/gdb/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/src/go
	   /usr/local/cs/src/go/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/src/ocaml
	   /usr/local/cs/src/ocaml/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/src/tar
	   /usr/local/cs/src/tar/RCS
	   /usr/local/cs/include/c++
	   /usr/local/cs/lib64
	   /usr/local/cs/share
	   /usr/local/cs/share/info
	   /usr/local/cs/share/man/man1
	   /usr/local/cs/share/man/man7
	   /usr/local/cs/share/man/man5
	   /usr/local/cs/share/man/man3
	   /usr/local/cs/bin
	   /usr/local/cs/bin/.del
	   /usr/local/cs/lib
	   /usr/local/cs/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
	   /usr/local/cs/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/include
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/include/gdb
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/lib
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/info
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/python
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/python/gdb
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/python/gdb/command
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/python/gdb/function
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/python/gdb/printer
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/syscalls
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/gdb/system-gdbinit
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/man
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/man/man5
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/share/man/man1
	   /usr/local/cs/gdb-9.1/bin
	   /usr/local/cs/.del
	   
8. I searched for the path of find using which find, outputing the file location: /usr/bin/find
   Shell command, find /usr/bin -type l | wc -l, outputs 292 lines meaning there are 292 files that are symbolic links
   Shell command, find /usr/bin -type l, outputs the files. The first 5 are:
   	 /usr/bin
	 /usr/bin/scanimage
	 /usr/bin/grub2-mkfont
	 /usr/bin/ppmeharge
	 /usr/bin/numastat

9. man ls to learn about the flags to limit my search
   Shell command, ls -a -t -l /usr/lib64, lists all files in the dir sorted by last modified date. The last file (the oldest file) is librom1394.so.0.3.0

10. man locale to read about the program
    locale gets its data from its settings from its definition files such as:
    	   LC_CTYPE
	   LC_NUMERIC
	   LC_TIME
	   LC_COLLATE
	   LC_MONETARY

11. C-h a downcase RET:
    	downcase-dwin (M-x ... RET)
	downcase-region (C-x C-l)
	downcase-word  (M-l)

12. C-h k:
    	C-M-r: isearch-backward-regexp (incremental serach backwards for regular expression)
	C-M-s: isearch-forward-regexp (increment search forwards for regular expression)
	C-M-t:  transpose-sexps (like transposing  characters but with sexps)
 	C-M-u: backward-up-list  (move backward out of one level of parenthesis)
	C-M-v: scroll-other-window (scroll next window upward ARG lines; or near full screen if no ARG)

13. C-h k C-g
    C-g is keyboard quit which signals a 'quit' condition. During assertion of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly. At top-level, as an editor command, this simply beeps.

14. C-h f yank RET
    yank is bound to C-y and its function is to reinsert "paste" the last stretch of killed text (from kill ring)

15. C-h f dired RET : dired is bound to C-x d
    emacs C-x d /usr/bin prints 2840 files whereas ls -l /usr/bin |  wc -l only shows that ls -l /usr/bin prints 2438 files.
    After remembering that -a flag has to be included in ls command to show . files, I noticed that "." and ".." are the missing two files from the ls -l command method of listing the directions. Thus, the main different of these two methods is that emacs dired commands lists . files by default.
