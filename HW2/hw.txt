Command logs for key and signature generation:
gpg2 --gen-key
     1 Enter 2048 Enter 0 Enter y Enter jackzhao Enter thejackzhao@ucla.edu Enter cs35l Enter o Enter

gpg2 --armor --export thejackzhao@ucla.edu >> ~/CS35L/hw-pubkey.asc
cd CS35L
gpg2 --output hw-pubkey.sig --detach-sig hw-pubkey.asc

1. If other teams were able to observe data across the network, that would not be sufficient because the data is still encrypted and requires the private key to decrypt it.

1.1 However, if they had tapped my keyboard, they would be able to obtain my passphrase. With that, they can simply ssh using the passphrase and have access to the private key.

1.2 If they had physical control of the USB, they would also be able to have direct to the .ssh file and obtain the private key.

2. --verify is a command that only checks to see if the signature matches the public key. In other words, there is no cross-check of the origin of the signature and key in relation to data. Thus, it can't verify if someone were to intercept the signature/key and pass along their own signature/key for verification. A solution to this would be for the author of the data to also publish his/her own public key so that the clients can cross-match verifcation and origin of the signature/key.
