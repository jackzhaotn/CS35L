Assignment 2: SSH setup and use in applications

Laboratory

1) SSH into lnxsrv09 as "client" and verify .ssh folder
   ls -a
   .ssh is present already so
   cd .ssh

2) Generate SSH keys:
   ssh-keygen
   File to save the key in: 35Lweek2
   Entered in a passphrase because thats good security
   Key's fingerpring is shown
   Key's randomart image is generated too
   ls -l
   Public key is saved under 35Lweek2.pub (-rw-r--r--)
   Private key is saved under 35week2 (-rw------)

3) Update the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file on lnxsrv07
   Login to lnxsrv07 and access ssh file:
   cd .ssh
   Create authorized keys file:
   touch authorized_keys
   Update permissions on that file:
   chmod 600 authorized_keys
   Append the contents of public key to authorized_keys file:
   cat 35Lweek2.pub >> authorized_keys

4) Confirm login with SSH key
   Go back to lnxsrv09 and confirm:
   ssh -i 35Lweek2 shijie@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.net
   Prompt appears with password input
   After typing in password, SSH key is confirmed to work

5) Make use of ssh-agent
   exit lnxsrv07
   cd .ssh
   eval `ssh-agent`
   (Agent pid 40065)
   Add key to ssh-agent:
   ssh-add 35Lweek2
   Enter in password:
   (Identity added: 35Lweek2 (35Lweek2))
   ssh -i 35Lweek2 shijie@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.net
   Confirmed sucessful login without passphase prompt
 
6) Port-Forwarding with X-Window
   Installed XQuartz for Mac
   Enable port forwarding with -X flag:
   ssh -X shijie@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
   xeyes
   GUI of eyes following my cursor appear, meaning port-forwarding is sucessfully setup.

7) Multi-hop from local machine to lnxsrv09 to lnxsrv07 directly
   Will use the "Quick and Dirty" method
   First, need to generate keys on local machine in .ssh directory
   cd .ssh
   ssh-key
   Enter file in which to save the key: id_rsa
   Enter in passphrase: ******
   Now that the public and private keys are generated, I need to copy them to the authorized_keys file on the server:
   ssh-copy-id shijie@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu
   Enter in passphrase: ******
   Now, use ssh-agent:
   eval `ssh-agent`
   ssh-add id_rsa
   Enter in passphrase: ******
   Now, we test the "Quick and Dirty" method with 1 line of command:
   ssh -A -t shijie@Lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A -t shijie@lnxsrv07.ucla.edu
   Successfully logged into lnxsrv07 with no password prompts
