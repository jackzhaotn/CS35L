Homework 4 Questions:

Q1. From a time complexity standpoint, the performance of ls should become
better since the patch removes a condition statement in the switch code.
With less instructions, the program should execute faster.
                                                                              
Q2. While this patch solved the -aA problem, now the flag order of -aA or -Aa
is important. So the intent of using the two orders of the flags has to be
watched out for. This new version could also have compatibility issues. Not to
mention, if the developer releases a patch in the future that overlaps with our
patch, more issues could arise.

Q3. IndexError is invoked since a random line is to be selected when there is
none; so there is an out of bounds error for trying to access a line thats not
in the scope.

Q4. SyntaxError: invalid syntax is called because Python 3 no longer supports
IOError

Q5. My script runs the same on python2 as it does on python3. I guess all my
code, including argparse, is compatible on python2.
