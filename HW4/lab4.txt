Laboratory 4: Installing a small change to a big package

1) I need to download some relevant files, namely the source code, signtaure,
and GNU keyring.
   $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
   $ wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
   $ wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

   Now I need to unzip the tarball file and verify its signature

   $ tar -xJvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz

   $ gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

   Outputs:
	gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID
	306037D9
	gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
	gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
	gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
	gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
	gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs
	to the owner.
	Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F
	D971 3060 37D9

   There is a warning because the key is public and thus not verfied by me

2) First, I read about the installation readme
   $ cd coreutils-8.29
   $ cat INSTALL

   Now, I know to install with ./configure --prefix, and I want it to install
   in a temp dir, lab4install:
   $ mkdir lab4install
   $ ./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/shijie/CS35L/lab4install/coreutils-8.29
   After ./configure is finished, I will now use make and make install to
   compile
   $ make
   $ make install

   $ cd bin
   $ ls
   All the executables are in the directory so everything looks good, and there
   were no problems

3) Now I want to test and reproduce the bug.
   $ ./ls -aA
   We can see that the bug is reproduced in that '.' and '..' still shows

4) cd ~/CS35L/lab4install/coreutils-8.29
   Now I want to create the patch file.
   $ emacs ls.patch
   Copy/paste the patch from message#10 into ls.patch

   $ patch -p1 < ls.patch
   This command will upload the patch

   $ make
   But this warning pops up: 'automake-1.15' is missing
   So after looking up the problem, I have use this command:
   $ autoreconf -f -i
   $ make
   $ make install

   $ cd bin
   $ ./ls -aA
   The patch successfully fixed the bug. The hidden files do not appear anymore
